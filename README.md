# BlunderCats

This is very much a work in progress but seeks to serve fail/win images (for
campfire, etc.) moderated by your team members

## GOALS (roughly in order of implementation):
* allow teams to select a curated group of people to add new win/fail images
  to a team-specific list
* expose an API that allows people to get a random win/fail image
* have example scripts for integrating win/fail images into campfire, etc.
  based on the results of an automated build
* allow teams to find images that other teams are using

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests
This isn't great code (no tests!) but that doesn't mean I'd ignore good patches.

 * Fork the project.
 * Make your feature addition or bug fix.
 * Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
